# Snake_and_Ladders Game (C++)
This is a simple implementation of the Snake and Ladders game developed using C++. The game follows the traditional rules of Snake and Ladders, where players roll dice and move their tokens along the board, encountering snakes and ladders that can either boost their progress or hinder it.

## How to Play
1]Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.

2]Run the compiled executable to start the game.

3]Follow the prompts to enter the number of players and their names.

4]Roll the dice when it's your turn and move your token accordingly.

5]Continue playing until one of the players reaches or exceeds the final position (usually 100) to win the game.

## Features
1]Supports multiple players, allowing for a multiplayer gaming experience.

2]Random dice rolling simulation to determine the number of steps to move.

3]Interactive board representation to visualize player positions.

4]Snakes and ladders with predefined start and end positions for added excitement.

5]Error handling for invalid input and out-of-bounds moves.

## Requirements
To compile and run the game, you need:

1]C++ compiler (supporting C++11 or higher)

2]Standard C++ library

3]Turbo+
